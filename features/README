These features really only make sense to write when I'm trying to figure out what
functionality I want to add. When I already know it just seems redundant to do it
here since this app is such a low level library.

The Cucumber methodologies don't seem to be necessary most of the time since
RSpec seems to be a more natural fit for a programming library. I'm probably
wrong but it really does seem to be a lot of redundancy for this application.

Oh, plus my feature specs suck... I'm still learning.
